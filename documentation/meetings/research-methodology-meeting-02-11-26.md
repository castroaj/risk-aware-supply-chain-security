Implicit disadvantage due to collaboration

More each other into areas of growth instead of comfort

Be vulnerable in the things you share

Linear thinking is not real world, think about possibilities

How do we ensure that contributions are visible? To your managers? To your team members? to your skips?

1-1's:
Where have you been?
What is your plan for where are you going?
What are your the concerns you have? 

Make sure to have questions prepared
    - Get the most of your managers time
    - Make sure trust is established
